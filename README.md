# GettingAndCleaningData
Course 

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps to create a tidy data set:

1) Download the files from the assignment.
2) Download the data source files and save them on your local drive. 
3) Open the run_analyis.r script, save it in the same folder and change all directories to your local directory (place where your data files are saved). 
4) Run the R file. 
Result: a tidy data set!

Dependencies

run_analysis.R file will install reshape2 and data.table packages.
